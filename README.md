# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-ML
This project aims to predict whether an individual has diabetes using a machine learning approach. The model is built using various classification algorithms, and its performance is evaluated to select the best model for prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from kaggle, consisting of 800 rows approximately and 9 features, including:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (Target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes)

##  Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning to predict diabetes. The selected model provides a reliable tool for identifying individuals at risk of diabetes, which can be further refined and expanded for real-world applications.
